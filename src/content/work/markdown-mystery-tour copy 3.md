> Gas Consumption Tracking Mobile App – Startup Project

As part of a startup initiative, I designed a mobile app prototype that empowers users to track their gas consumption, view billing history, and receive personalized alerts. The project began with thorough market research and a competitive analysis of Sonelgaz’s existing digital services. I led the UI/UX design using Figma, applying a user-centered approach focused on usability and engagement. This project showcases my ability to design practical, scalable solutions for real-world utility challenges within a startup context.
