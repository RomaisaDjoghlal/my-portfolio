> University Services Mobile App

I designed the visual identity, prototypes, and overall UI/UX for a mobile app aimed at university students to manage their scholarship, accommodation, and transportation requests. The app also provides real-time updates and tracking of these services, enhancing user experience and simplifying administrative processes. My work focused on creating an intuitive, accessible, and cohesive design system that meets the needs of diverse student profiles while ensuring a smooth and engaging user journey.
