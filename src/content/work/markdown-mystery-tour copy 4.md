> Scholarship Management Web App

After conducting a field visit to the USTHB scholarship office, I identified key pain points and inefficiencies in the process of managing student scholarship applications. Based on these real needs, I designed a UI/UX prototype for a web-based platform tailored to streamline and modernize the scholarship management process.

This platform is designed to facilitate:Online submission of scholarship applications by students.Digital review and validation of documents by administrative staff.Transparent tracking of application status for students.Efficient internal workflow for scholarship officers, reducing paperwork and manual errors.
