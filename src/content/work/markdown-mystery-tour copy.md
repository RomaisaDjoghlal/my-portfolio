> Hospital Management Web Application

As part of a collaborative team of six, I contributed significantly to the design and development of a hospital management web application. My main responsibilities included crafting the UI/UX design using Figma, with a strong focus on accessibility, intuitive user flows, and tailoring the experience for diverse medical profiles. Additionally, I developed the front-end with Angular, ensuring seamless implementation and perfect consistency with the design mockups. This project strengthened both my teamwork skills and my expertise in UI/UX design and front-end development.
