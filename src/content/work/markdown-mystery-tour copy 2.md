> Petri Nets Web Application

As part of a team, I played a key role in developing a full-stack web application focused on the creation and analysis of Petri nets for our second-year project. I was responsible for designing approximately 80% of the user interface, crafting a user-friendly and intuitive UI that impressed the client. Additionally, I developed the front-end using React.js, ensuring smooth integration between design and functionality.
